In 2024, chatbots and virtual characters will become a lot more popular, both for utility and for fun. As a result, conversing socially with machines will start to feel less niche and more ordinary - including our emotional attachments to them.

Research in human-computer and human-robot interaction shows that we love to anthropomorphize - attribute humanlike qualities, behaviors, and emotions to - the nonhuman agents we interact with, especially if they mimic cues we recognize.

And, thanks to recent advances in conversational AI, our machines are suddenly very skilled at one of those cues: language.

Friend bots, therapy bots, and love bots are flooding the app stores as people become curious about this new generation of AI-powered virtual agents. The possibilities for education, health, and entertainment are endless.

But it's risky to consumers (and to company PR teams) to mass-deploy something that could give people discriminatory, false, or otherwise harmful information.

After all, people do listen to their virtual friends. A lot of experimental lab research shows that humans can and will become emotionally attached to bots. The science also demonstrates that people, in their eagerness to socialize, will happily disclose personal information to an artifical agent and will even shift their beliefs and behavior.

This raises some consumer-protection questions around how companies use this technology to manipulate their user base.

In the coming year we'll gradually start acknowledgung - and taking more seriously - these fundamentally human behaviors. Because in 2024, it will finally hit home: Machines are not exempt from our social relationships.

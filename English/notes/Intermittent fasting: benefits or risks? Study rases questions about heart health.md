  Intermittent fasting has become the diet trend of the decade.
  
  It promises to hack biology without the drudgery of counting calories or cutting carbs: simply change when you eat, not necessarily what you eat. Tech moguls swear by it. Hoollywood stars insist it keeps them trim.
  
  So far the science has seemed suppoetive. Research suggests that extending the overnight fast may improve metabolism, aid cellular repair and perhaps even prolong life. Nutritionists, however, have long warned that skipping meals is no magic bullet - and may be risky for those with underlying condition.

  Now, the first large-scale study of its kind raises a more serious red flag. Researchers, analysing data from more than 19000 adults, found that those who confined their eating to less than eight hours a day faced a 135% higher risk of dying from cardiovasular disease - issues with the heart and blood vessel - than people who ate over 12-14 hours.

  They found the elevated cardiovascular risk was consistent across socioeconomic group, and stongest among smokers and people with diabetes or existing heart disease.

  That runs counter to the popular belif - supported by short-term studies lasting only a few months to a year - that time-restricted eating improves heart and metabolic health.

  Clearly, for now, the message is less about abandoning fasting altogether and more about tailoring it to an individual's risk profile. Until the evidence is clearer, the safest bet may be to focus less on the clock and more on the plate.

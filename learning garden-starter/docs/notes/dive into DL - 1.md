# 第一天的探索
## To prepare for your dive into deep learning
- techniques for storing and manipulating data
- libraries for ingesting and preprocessing data from a variety of sources
- knowledge of the `basic linear algebraic operations` that we apply to high-dimensional data elements
- just enough `calculus` to determine which direction to adjust each parameter in order to decrease the loss function
- the ability to automatically compute derivatives so that you can forget much of the calculus you just learned
- some basic fluency in probability, our primary language for reasoning under uncertainty
